# Assignment

## 1 - Vector Calculations

Fill in the missing code in the [Python files](https://github.com/augmentedfabricationlab/afab_course/tree/master/03_geometry/assignment) with the following tasks:

* 1a: Given two vectors, use the cross product to create a set of three orthonormal vectors.

* 1b: Use the cross product to compute the area of a convex, 2D polygon.

* 1c: Define a function for computing the cross products of two same-length arrays of vectors by
    * Prototype in pure Python (loop over the arrays).
    * Make Numpy equivalent without loops.

## 2 - Recursive Functions

#### 2a Recursive Branching Lines

Write a recursive function in Grasshopper Python, which creates a random 2D or 3D branching structure. Fill in the missing code in the Python component in the ghx file [assignment_2a_recursion_branches_lines.ghx](assignment/assignment_2a_recursion_branches_lines.ghx).

The output of the 2D and 3D branching should look similar to this:

output 2d  | output 3d
---- | ---- 
<img src="images/branches2d.jpg" width="300px" a/> | <img src="images/branches3d.jpg" width="300px" a/><br>


#### 2b Recursive Branching Boxes

Write a recursive function for in Grasshopper Python, which creates a random 3D branching structure with boxes around the branches. Fill in the missing code in the Python component in the ghx file [assignment_2b_recursion_branches_boxes.ghx](assignment/assignment_2b_recursion_branches_boxes.ghx).

The output of the 3D recursive boxes should look similar to this:

| output 3d  |
| ---- |
| <img src="images/boxes3d.jpg" width="300px" a/> |
